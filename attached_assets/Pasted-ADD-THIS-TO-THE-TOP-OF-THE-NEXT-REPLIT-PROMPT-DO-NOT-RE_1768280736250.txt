ADD THIS TO THE TOP OF THE NEXT REPLIT PROMPT (DO NOT REWRITE THE APP; EXTEND IT)

GOAL
1) When a plan/calendar is “done”, instructors can PUBLISH it for a student-facing view.
2) Students can VIEW published calendars read-only (no edits, no drag/drop, no template changes).
3) If the instructor updates the plan later, the student view automatically reflects the latest version.
4) Make the home screen UI less boring and more usable (still not using ANEW branding). No icons anywhere in the UI.

ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do not invent features or skip requirements. Build exactly what is requested.
- This is an ADD-ON to the existing repo and existing features (Import ICS / Paste ICS / Screenshot / Backup / Create New Plan / drag-drop). Keep everything working.
- No icons: remove any icon components/emoji in buttons and headers. Text-only UI.
- Keep 15-minute scheduling logic intact (or improve it if currently buggy), but do not break current plans.

FEATURE: PUBLISH FOR STUDENTS (READ-ONLY)
Add a publishing system per plan:

Data model (backward compatible):
- Plan has:
  - isPublished: boolean (default false)
  - publishedAt: ISO string | null
  - publicId: string | null (unguessable token, e.g., 16–24 chars)
  - updatedAt: ISO string (already exists? if not, add)
  - lastPublishedSnapshotId: optional (only if you already have snapshots; otherwise skip)

Publishing behavior:
- In instructor plan editor (where the calendar grid is), add a clear “Publish” / “Unpublish” control.
- When Publish is clicked:
  - Set isPublished = true
  - Set publishedAt = now
  - Generate publicId if missing (must remain stable across re-publish unless user explicitly “Regenerate Link”)
  - Show a “Student Link” section with:
    - Copy link button (text-only button)
    - The actual URL displayed as selectable text
- When Unpublish is clicked:
  - Set isPublished = false
  - Student link becomes inaccessible (404 or “Not available” page)
- Optional but wanted: “Regenerate Link” (text-only) that rotates publicId and invalidates old link.

Student-facing route:
- Create a new route like:
  - /student/:publicId
- This page:
  - Loads the plan by publicId only if isPublished = true
  - Renders the same calendar grid view BUT locked:
    - No drag/drop
    - No resizing
    - No “Edit Block” panel
    - No template library
    - No export/import
  - Shows:
    - Plan name
    - Cohort (if your plan has it)
    - Week selector (view-only)
    - “Last updated” timestamp (plan.updatedAt)
- IMPORTANT: Student view must always reflect the latest plan data (not a one-time snapshot) unless the existing app architecture requires snapshots. If snapshots are required, then on each save update the published snapshot automatically.

Permissions / safety:
- If your app already has roles (instructor/admin vs student), use them:
  - Instructors can publish/unpublish
  - Students can only access /student/:publicId
- If there is no auth system, publishing must still work via the unguessable publicId link (read-only).

Change visibility:
- Student view should display a simple “Updated:” timestamp so students know something changed.
- If easy and already supported, add a tiny “Recent Changes” log (max last 10 changes: timestamp + summary like “Week 3: added OSHA 10 block”). If not easy, skip; timestamp alone is required.

UI IMPROVEMENTS (HOME SCREEN + PLAN LIST)
The current interface is functional but bland. Improve without icons and without ANEW branding:

Home layout:
- Keep the same actions, but reorganize for clarity:
  1) Header row: Title + short subtitle (what this tool does)
  2) Primary actions row: “Create New Plan” as primary button
  3) Import section as a card beneath it:
     - Tabs or segmented buttons (text-only): “Import ICS”, “Paste ICS”, “Import Spreadsheet (CSV/XLSX)”, “Import Screenshot (OCR)”, “Import Backup (JSON)”
     - Keep drag-and-drop zone visible and clearly labeled.
  4) Plans list area:
     - Show plan cards (even if empty state)
     - Each plan card shows: name, created date, last updated date, published status (text badge like “Published” / “Draft”), and a “Open” button.
- Empty state:
  - Replace “No plans created yet” with a more helpful empty card:
    - “Create your first plan”
    - 3 bullet steps (text only): Create plan → Add blocks → Publish for students
  - Add a subtle decorative background using CSS only (no icons): soft gradient, pattern, or subtle grid texture.

Visual style changes (still clean, just less sterile):
- Use a warmer palette and depth:
  - Soft page background (very light tint)
  - Cards with light borders + slightly stronger shadow
  - Rounded corners consistent
  - Buttons with clear hierarchy (primary/secondary/ghost)
- Typography:
  - Slightly larger page title
  - Subtitles and helper text readable
- Remove icon glyphs from all buttons (replace with text labels only).
- Keep everything accessible (contrast, focus states).

PLAN EDITOR PAGE: PUBLISH CONTROL + BETTER RIGHT PANEL
- If the plan editor already has a right panel for editing blocks:
  - Add a new top section: “Plan Status”
    - Draft/Published state
    - Publish/Unpublish button
    - Student link + copy button (only when published)
- Student link must be obvious and fast to copy.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST (MUST PASS)
- Create a plan → schedule blocks → Publish → open student link in a private window → calendar visible, read-only.
- Edit the plan after publishing (move/add a block) → refresh student page → changes visible and updated timestamp changes.
- Unpublish → student link no longer shows the calendar.
- No icons anywhere (buttons, headers, panels).
- No breaking changes: importing, exporting, existing editor functions still work.

DELIVERABLES
- Implement the feature in the current repo with exact code changes.
- Show the exact new routes/files added and what existing files were modified.
- Keep everything deterministic and working; no TODOs, no placeholders.
